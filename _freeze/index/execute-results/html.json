I'm Julianna\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\n\n## A bit about me\n\nI'm a marine community ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes are altering coastal ecosystems and what those changes mean for ecosystem stability. I completed my M.S. in the \\[Silliman Lab\\](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/silliman/) at Duke University and am currently a fifth-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the\n\n\\[Burkepile Lab\\](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/). In my research I integrate a combination of field experimentation, lab work, and ecological modeling to understand how changing levels of biodiversity influence communities in both temperate and tropical nearshore systems.\n\n\\<img src=\"images/photo.png\" width=\"100%\"/\\>\n\n## Running Code\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n",
