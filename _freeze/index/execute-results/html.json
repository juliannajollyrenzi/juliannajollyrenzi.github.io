I completed my M.S. in the [Silliman Lab](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/silliman/) at Duke University and am currently a fifth-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the [Burkepile Lab](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/). In my research I integrate a combination of field experimentation, lab work, and ecological modeling to understand how changing levels of biodiversity influence communities in both temperate and tropical nearshore systems.\n\n\\<img src=\"images/MRB_Renzi_4.JPG\" width=\"100%\"/\\>\n\n## Running Code\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n",
