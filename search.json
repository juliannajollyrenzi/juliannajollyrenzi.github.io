I completed my M.S. in the Silliman Lab at Duke University and am currently a fifth-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the Burkepile Lab. In my research I integrate a combination of field experimentation, lab work, and ecological modeling to understand how changing levels of biodiversity influence communities in both temperate and tropical nearshore systems.\n&lt;img src=“images/MRB_Renzi_4.JPG” width=“100%”/&gt;"
