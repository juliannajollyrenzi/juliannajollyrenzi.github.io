    "text": "I’m a marine community ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes are altering coastal ecosystems and what those changes mean for ecosystem stability. I completed my M.S. in the Silliman Lab at Duke University and am currently a fifth-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the Burkepile Lab. In my research I integrate a combination of field experimentation, lab work, and ecological modeling to understand how changing levels of biodiversity influence communities in both temperate and tropical nearshore systems."
