## A bit about me

I'm a marine community ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes are altering coastal ecosystems and what those changes mean for ecosystem stability. I completed my M.S. in the \[Silliman Lab\](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/silliman/) at Duke University and am currently a fifth-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the

\[Burkepile Lab\](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/). In my research I integrate a combination of field experimentation, lab work, and ecological modeling to understand how changing levels of biodiversity influence communities in both temperate and tropical nearshore systems.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
