## 

<center>I'm a marine community ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes are altering coastal ecosystems and what those changes mean for ecosystem stability. I completed my M.S. in the [Silliman Lab](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/silliman/) at Duke University and am currently a fifth-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the [Burkepile Lab](https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/burkepile/deron/). In my research I integrate a combination of field experimentation, lab work, and ecological modeling to understand how changing levels of biodiversity influence communities in both temperate and tropical nearshore systems.</center>
